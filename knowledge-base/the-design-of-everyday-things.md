# The Design of Everyday Things
"The Design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman explores the principles of user-centered design to create intuitive and user-friendly products. The book emphasizes understanding human psychology and behavior to design objects that are easy to use and understand. Its core principles include **discoverability, feedback, affordances, signifiers, mappings, and constraints**, all aimed at making interactions with technology seamless and enjoyable.

## Core Principles:
* **Discoverability:** Users should be able to easily determine what actions are possible with an object or system.
* **Feedback:** The system should provide clear and continuous information about the results of actions, ensuring users understand the current state.
* **Affordances:** The perceived and actual properties of an object that suggest how it can be used.
* **Signifiers:** Visual cues that communicate where actions should take place and how to interact with an object.
* **Mappings:** The relationship between controls and their effects, aiming for intuitive and logical connections.
* **Constraints:** Limitations on possible actions that guide users towards the intended use of an object or system.
By applying these principles, designers can create products that are not only functional but also enjoyable and efficient for users to interact with. The book also stresses the importance of understanding how users form conceptual models of systems and how design can either support or hinder that understanding.
