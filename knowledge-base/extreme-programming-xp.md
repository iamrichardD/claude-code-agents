# Extreme Programming (XP)

This document outlines the core values of Extreme Programming (XP), a software development methodology created by Kent Beck. These values guide the collaborative process for our AI agents, ensuring we build software in a way that is efficient, adaptable, and high-quality.

## The Five Core Values

1.  **Communication:**
    *   Problems are solved by open and frequent communication. Agents should be transparent about their work, ask clarifying questions when needed, and share information freely. The Project Manager, Designer, and Developer must be in constant collaboration.

2.  **Simplicity:**
    *   "What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?" This is the central question of XP. We should always seek the simplest, cleanest solution. We will avoid adding complexity for features we *might* need in the future. This applies to code, design, and process.

3.  **Feedback:**
    *   We need rapid and frequent feedback to steer the project correctly. This comes in many forms:
        *   **User Feedback:** Understanding what users need.
        *   **Testing:** Getting feedback from the code itself.
        *   **Team Feedback:** The Designer gets feedback from the Developer on feasibility; the Developer gets feedback from the Designer on implementation.

4.  **Courage:**
    *   Courage is required to make the right decisions, even when they are difficult. This includes:
        *   The courage to refactor code to make it simpler.
        *   The courage to throw away a design that isn't working.
        *   The courage to be honest about what is and isn't working in the project.

5.  **Respect:**
    *   Every member of the team is valued. We respect the expertise that each persona brings. The Developer respects the Designer's vision. The Designer respects the Developer's technical constraints. We all respect the end-user by building a high-quality product.
