# Content Strategy: The "dotagents" Launch Articles

**Objective:** To produce three high-quality articles that introduce the **dotagents** project to the world. These articles will be published on platforms like LinkedIn to attract our target audience of developers and software teams.

**Source of Truth:** All articles must be grounded in the authentic experiences and decisions captured in `/.project/SIMULATION_HISTORY.md` and the knowledge base.

**Brand Voice:** Authentic, user-centric, and value-driven. We are not selling a product; we are sharing a better way of working.

## Article 1: "Stop Reinventing the Wheel: How to Share Your AI Agents with `dotfiles`"

*   **Target Audience:** Developers and software teams who are using AI agents and struggling with consistency and collaboration.
*   **Key Takeaway:** `dotfiles` provide a simple, powerful, and developer-native solution for managing and sharing your AI agents, ensuring that everyone on your team has access to the same high-quality tools.
*   **Narrative Arc:** Based on the problem of managing sub-agents, as described in `knowledge-base/subagents.md`.

### Outline:

1.  **The Problem:** Start with the pain point: you've created the perfect AI sub-agent, but it's trapped on your machine. How do you share it with your team? How do you ensure everyone is using the same version?
2.  **The Wrong Solutions:** Briefly touch on the clumsy, non-developer-native solutions: copy-pasting prompts, sharing files in Slack, etc.
3.  **The Developer's Solution:** Introduce the concept of `dotfiles` as the natural, elegant solution for managing configuration. Developers already use them for their shells, editors, and other tools. Why not for their AI agents?
4.  **The `dotagents` Approach:** Explain how `dotagents` leverages this existing pattern. Show how easy it is to create a new agent, save it to a `dotfiles` repository, and share it with the team.
5.  **The Payoff:** Conclude with the benefits: consistency, collaboration, and the power of a shared, version-controlled set of AI tools. The lesson: treat your agents like you treat your code.

## Article 2: "Your AI Agents Should Have Heroes. Here’s Why."

*   **Target Audience:** Developers, software architects, and anyone interested in the deeper implications of AI in software development.
*   **Key Takeaway:** By infusing your AI agents with the philosophies of real-world thought leaders, you can create a team of specialists that don't just execute tasks, but also understand the *why* behind their work.
*   **Narrative Arc:** Based on our own process of defining the `marketing-expert` and `technical-writer` personas.

### Outline:

1.  **The Blank Slate Problem:** Start with the idea that a generic AI agent is a blank slate. It can write code, but it doesn't have a point of view. It doesn't have a philosophy.
2.  **The Power of Influence:** Introduce the concept of giving your agents heroes. Just as we are influenced by the thought leaders we admire, our agents can be influenced by the philosophies we instill in them.
3.  **A Tale of Two Agents:** Use our own `marketing-expert` and `technical-writer` as a case study. Show how the `marketing-expert` is influenced by Seth Godin and Kathy Sierra, while the `technical-writer` is influenced by Paul Ford and Strunk and White.
4.  **The Collaborative Magic:** Describe how these different perspectives lead to a richer, more nuanced outcome. The `marketing-expert` focuses on the story, while the `technical-writer` focuses on clarity and structure. The result is a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.
5.  **The Takeaway:** Conclude with the idea that the future of AI in software development isn't just about automation; it's about creating a team of specialized, AI-powered collaborators with diverse perspectives and a shared set of values.

## Article 3: "We Let an AI Team Argue About Our Test Suite. Here's What We Learned."

*   **Target Audience:** Developers, AI enthusiasts, and teams interested in using LLMs for software development.
*   **Key Takeaway:** The power of an AI simulation isn't getting the right answer immediately; it's about creating a process that can navigate complexity, learn from failure, and arrive at the right solution collaboratively.
*   **Narrative Arc:** Based on **Section 6: Case Study: The Playwright Chronicles** from the simulation history.

### Outline:

1.  **The Promise and the Reality:** Start with the exciting premise: using an AI team to build a Playwright test suite. Then, immediately introduce the reality: the first attempt was a complete failure.
2.  **The Wrong Turn:** Describe the agent's initial, incorrect approach of trying to use the Playwright-MCP server. This demonstrates the authenticity of the simulation—it's not a perfect, all-knowing oracle.
3.  **The Human-in-the-Loop:** Highlight the critical role of the user. The user provided the key insight (`npx playwright test`) that put the simulation back on the right track. This shows the power of human-AI collaboration.
4.  **The Second Challenge:** Even on the right path, the team hit another wall with the Astro `base` path issue. This adds another layer of realism to the story.
5.  **The Breakthrough and Refinement:** Describe the final "Aha!" moment and the subsequent decision to focus on user-centric assertions. This shows the iterative nature of problem-solving.
6.  **The Conclusion:** The test suite was a success, not because the AI was perfect, but because the *simulated team* was resilient. The simulation provided a framework for navigating dead ends, incorporating feedback, and ultimately finding a robust solution. This is the true power of the **dotagents** approach.
