# 001: Technology Stack Selection

**Date:** 2025-07-29
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The project requires a technology stack to build a static GitHub Pages site for documentation and project information. The decision must be strongly aligned with our core team philosophies, which are documented in our knowledge base:

-   **HTML First & Mobile First** (from the Designer persona)
-   **Extreme Programming (XP)** values, especially Simplicity (from the Agile Coach persona)
-   **Making Users Awesome**, which demands a focus on performance and accessibility (a shared team goal)

## Decision

After a simulated team discussion involving the Project Manager, Agile Coach, Designer, and Frontend Developer, we reached a unanimous consensus:

We will use **Astro** as the primary static site generator. We will also adopt standards-based **Web Components** as a strategic tool for complex, self-contained UI elements where their strong encapsulation is beneficial.

## Consequences

### Positive:

-   **Aligns with Philosophy:** Astro's "zero JS by default" and content-first approach perfectly matches our established principles.
-   **Excellent Developer Experience (DX):** Provides a modern, component-based workflow that is efficient and maintainable.
-   **High Performance:** The resulting site will be extremely fast and lightweight, directly contributing to a better user experience.
-   **Future-Proof & Flexible:** The strategic adoption of Web Components gives us a powerful, standards-based option for complex UI without locking us into a single framework's ecosystem.
-   **Team Buy-in:** The decision was a collaborative effort, ensuring all personas are aligned and committed.

### Negative:

-   There may be a slight learning curve for any team members who are unfamiliar with Astro's `.astro` component syntax.

## Options Considered

-   **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS:** Rejected due to poor long-term maintainability and the high risk of code duplication.
-   **Jekyll:** Rejected as having a dated developer experience compared to modern alternatives.
-   **Next.js:** Rejected as being overly complex for a static documentation site, which would violate the XP value of Simplicity.
-   **Pure Web Components (for everything):** Rejected as a default due to verbose boilerplate for simple components. It was instead adopted as a strategic tool *within* Astro.
