# Paul Ford at Monktoberfest 2013: The Web and the Quest for the Perfect Document

## I. The Unending Web: An Enormous and Terrifying Landscape
Paul Ford, in his 2013 Monktoberfest talk, reflects on the daunting task of writing a book about web pages. He describes the web as "enormous and terrifying and never ends," an overwhelming subject for any single author. This sentiment underscores the rapid, chaotic, and unpredictable evolution of the internet.

### The Original Vision vs. Current Reality: "Let's Share What We Know"
Ford begins by referencing the initial motto of the Worldwide Web, coined by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau in 1992: "Let's share what we know." Cailliau, having synesthesia, even designed the original WWW logo in green because all "W"s were green to him. This motto encapsulated a foundational ideal of open knowledge sharing and collaboration. However, Ford laments that this spirit has largely faded, noting, "it's not that way necessarily anymore. I don't feel that when people sit down to create a new Enterprise the first thing they think is 'is let's share what we know'." This highlights a shift from a collaborative, document-centric web to one driven more by commercial interests and proprietary platforms.

## II. The Power of Absence: Filling the Gaps
A central theme of Ford's talk is the concept of "absence" and how new technologies and urban landscapes emerge to fill these gaps, often in unplanned and unforeseen ways. He draws parallels between the development of the web and the organic growth of cities.

### Coney Island Avenue: A Metaphor for Organic Growth
Ford uses Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn as a vivid metaphor for this idea. The street is a chaotic mix of diverse establishments—a crowded used bookstore, a Staples, a Dunkin Donuts, an Orthodox Jewish hat store, and "Little Pakistan." These seemingly random juxtapositions are not the result of grand planning but of individual needs and historical contingencies. For example, "Little Pakistan" exists because "the people who moved there were displaced in the 1960s... by the construction of the Monga Dam." Similarly, major thoroughfares in New York City, like King's Highway and Broadway, evolved from "Indian Paths" that were "put down by people who had absolutely no idea what was coming next." This "building on that over and over over hundreds of years" illustrates how spaces are shaped by incremental, often uncoordinated, actions rather than singular, overarching designs.

### The Taoist Perspective: Usefulness in Emptiness
Ford connects this observation to a quote from the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu: "Therefore what is present is used for profit but it is in absence that there is usefulness." This profound statement suggests that true utility or potential often lies in what is not explicitly defined or present. This resonates with the idea that the web's initial "absence"—its openness and lack of rigid structure—allowed for unforeseen innovation and growth.

### Talent as "Constructive Annoyance"
Ford redefines "talent" not as an inherent gift or the result of "10,000 hours" of practice (as popularized by Malcolm Gladwell), but as an "incredible ability to be annoyed." He describes talented individuals as those who perceive a "gap," an "emptiness that I have to fill," and are driven by an intense desire to fix or complete something. This "sensitivity" leads to a compulsive need to "make things right," often to the exclusion of other concerns. He humorously suggests that a more constructive hiring question than "Do you have a list of skills?" would be, "Do you get constructively annoyed by things enough to learn programming languages?" This reframes talent as a problem-solving drive, a compulsion to fill an observed absence, rather than merely a collection of proficiencies.

## III. The Web's Divergent Path: From Documents to Operating System
Ford delves into the foundational nature of the web, contrasting its initial vision with its current multifaceted reality.

### The Unfulfilled Vision of the Editable Web (Amaya)
The original vision for the web, exemplified by the W3C project "Amaya," was a "web editor, a tool used to create and update documents directly on the web." This concept envisioned a seamlessly integrated browsing and editing environment, reflecting the "original vision of the web as a space for collaboration and not just a one-way publishing medium." Ford posits that if this model had succeeded, the web would look dramatically different, potentially negating the need for extensive databases in the same way, and perhaps preventing the consolidation of power in platforms like Amazon, Wikipedia, Twitter, and Facebook. The shift to "little tiny text boxes and forms getting filled out with very simple pieces of text and getting logged in databases" was a "fall back" because the collaborative editing vision "wasn't quite there yet." This "failure" of the editable web led to the rise of data-driven platforms, which now constitute a "two trillion dollar economy."

### The Evolution of the Web: Beyond Documents and Links
Ford notes that the web, initially conceived as a "publication platform, a way to link documents," is now rapidly transforming into an "operating system." The inclusion of HTML5 APIs for "battery life" and other hardware functionalities signifies this shift. He questions how this new role, which is "no longer very abstract" and has "nothing to do with documents," will ultimately shape the web's identity.

## IV. The Persistence of "Skeuomorphs" and the Absence of Essence
Ford introduces the concept of "skeuomorphs" to critique the prevalent design philosophies in technology and to argue against the idea of an "essence" in computing.

### Skeuomorphism as a Lie
A skeuomorph is "an object whose shape or decoration copies the form of the object originally made from another material." Ford points to the old iOS calendar app, which mimicked a physical desk calendar with faux leather textures, as a prime example. While the design community celebrated the move away from such "tacky" designs with iOS 7's "clean lines," Ford argues that "everything on a computer that does not involve an individual running an infinite piece of tape back and forth in a turning machine or flipping a light switch back and forth a billion times a second everything's a skeuomorph." He provocatively states, "the alphabet is a skeuomorph," as it's an "ancient technology" originally used for "Sumerian grain yields" now applied to "brand new computers."

### No "Essence" in Technology
This leads to his core argument: "I personally have come I don't believe the technology has an Essence I don't believe there is a right way." He contends that all computer interfaces are essentially skeuomorphs built on binary arithmetic, and that "every new technology is trying to sort of fill cultural absences but ends up creating new spaces and new absences." This perspective challenges the notion that there's a "true and real and right way to do things" in digital design, suggesting that all design is an attempt to translate complex underlying systems into familiar, often anachronistic, forms.

## V. The Accumulation of History: Understanding File Formats and the Web's Past
Ford concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the historical layers and "absences" that define our technological present.

### The "Abysmal" Photoshop PSD Format
He illustrates this with a humorous yet insightful anecdote about the Photoshop PSD file format. A coder's comment describes PSD as "not a good format," "not even a bad format," but "an abysmal format." The programmer likens extracting data from a PSD file to "trying to find something in the Attic of your eccentric Old Uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark attack on his 58th birthday." This vivid description highlights how file formats, like city streets, accumulate "decades of decisions," "layers and the mistakes made and the unfinished thoughts." Despite the frustration for implementers, these complex, layered formats offer a unique window into the "best and worst aspects" of a system's evolution.

Colonizing the Web and the Largest Absence
Ford reflects on the early days of the web as a "huge open territory" that was "colonized." He acknowledges the nostalgia for that "old and smaller world" where a "few people playing around" could shape its development. However, he recognizes that this era is "gone," and that the web is now a "different world" where "you cannot stop things from moving." He concludes by stating that the "largest absence of the all" is "the past our shared past this shared story that we're all trying to tell and figure out what happened yesterday what happened 20 years ago." This underscores the ongoing challenge of making sense of the web's rapid, complex, and often unpredictable history.
