# Human + AI Collaboration: Building a Robust Application Specification with Prompt Engineering
From the early days of software development, before agile methodologies took hold, we relied heavily on large, prescriptive specification documents. However, the lengthy time required to create these exhaustive specifications, combined with the rapid evolution of user needs and software industry capabilities, often led to a critical problem: projects were frequently doomed to fail. Those of us writing the code often recognized this impending death march well in advance, voicing our concerns to little avail. Then, as an industry, we embraced agile principles, guided by the Agile Manifesto. Project managers adopted Scrum, and for a time, agile methodologies served us well. Now, we are entering the age of AI chat, assistants, and agents. The current trend of using prompts focused solely on adding a method or function or simply asking AI to fix this can yield code that looks correct initially but often results in untested or untestable code, less maintainable code, and a reduced understanding of the underlying mechanisms. So, how can software developers and engineers effectively leverage AI without sacrificing good software design principles, and instead enable AI to produce well-designed, well-structured, understandable, and tested code? To explore this, I experimented with AI-assisted specification documents, aiming to help AI chat assistants level up their code quality from the outset.

Knowing that clear direction is paramount, especially when leveraging AI tools, I recently experimented with a new approach for a software project I was defining. I asked myself: How could I provide the clearest direction for my AI assistant in order to produce well-written, well-structured, and tested code, effectively working as a pair-programming peer rather than in a senior/junior directive development model? My experiment led me to an unexpected answer: iterative prompt engineering with a conversational AI.

It was during a separate project, while striving to simulate an eXtreme Programming (XP) environment, that the power of detailed prompting truly clicked for me. Initially, my prompts were quite narrow and code-focused: create a docker-compose file or create a user repository file. I found myself in a cycle of manual revisions, feeling like the AI was just a slightly more sophisticated code snippet generator. Then, I realized the key was direction. Prompts like, For the project architecture, use a monorepo design, Vertical Slice Architecture, apply SOLID principles, Repository pattern, Domain-Driven Design, and apply Test-Driven Development principles, dramatically improved my development experience. It was like providing the AI with the blueprints, not just individual bricks.

This realization sparked an idea for my next project. Instead of just seeking code hints, I wondered if prompting could offer even more value earlier in the software lifecycle. I asked myself: How could I leverage AI to collaboratively work out application features and create the most robust specification possible? My experiment with this new project led me to an unexpected answer: iterative prompt engineering with a conversational AI. I discovered prompting has far more to offer a software engineer than just code snippets; it can be a powerful tool for creating the specification document AI needs itself. For a concrete example, you can review a couple of prompt documents I created using this process [PROMPT 1](https://github.com/iamrichardD/silentmeow/blob/main/PROMPT) and [PROMPT 2](https://github.com/iamrichardD/mewsings/blob/main/PROMPT).

## I. The Process: Step-by-Step Prompt Engineering for Application Specification

My journey to creating a robust application specification wasn't a single prompt and done. It was an iterative process, a dialogue with my AI chat assistant, where each prompt built upon the previous responses, progressively refining and detailing the application blueprint. Me and my AI chat assistant essentially walked through a series of key stages, using prompts to explore and solidify each aspect of the project. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core steps we followed, which can be adapted for virtually any software project:

* **Defining Core Modules & Features (The "What"):** I began by focusing on the fundamental building blocks of the application, working in tandem with my AI chat assistant. Through iterative prompting, we defined the essential modules and their core functionalities. For example, I started with broad questions like, "What are the core features of this application?" and then progressively drilled down, prompted by the AI chat responses: "For the 'Content Creation' module, what specific functionalities are essential for an MVP? Let's prioritize the must-have features for the initial release." This stage was about establishing the scope and essential functionality of the application, collaboratively with the AI chat assistant.

* **Establishing Technical Considerations (The "How" - Technology):** Once the core features were defined, I shifted to the technical landscape, again collaborating with my AI chat assistant. We used prompts to explore technology choices for the backend, frontend, database, real-time communication, deployment, and APIs. I asked questions like, "What are suitable backend technologies for a scalable web application?" and the AI chat would provide options, prompting me to further refine with questions like: "Considering performance and developer productivity, what are the pros and cons of NestJS vs. Express.js?" This stage was about making informed technology decisions and documenting the technical architecture through a collaborative dialogue with the AI chat. For example, in another project specification, to guide the AI assistant on the overall architectural direction from the outset, I included this prompt, which resulted in the following documented architectural blueprint:
```shell
# Project Architecture
* Monorepo design
* Vertical Slice Architecture
* SOLID principles
* Repository pattern
* Domain-Driven Design
```

This type of high-level architectural direction, provided through prompts, proved invaluable in shaping the detailed technical specifications that followed.

* **Addressing Scale and Performance (The "How" - Performance):** With the technology stack in mind, I addressed non-functional requirements related to scale and performance, working alongside my AI chat assistant. Prompts focused on defining realistic user load expectations for the MVP phase and setting qualitative performance targets. For instance, I might prompt: "For an MVP with an initial limited user base, what is a reasonable target for concurrent users?" and the AI chat would help explore considerations, leading to refined prompts like: "What level of responsiveness should we aim for in core user interactions for the MVP?" This stage was crucial for setting realistic performance expectations for the initial release and considering future scalability, all in collaboration with the AI chat assistant.

* **Defining Success Metrics (The "How" - Measurement):** A critical step was defining measurable success metrics. I used prompts, engaging in conversation with my AI chat assistant, to brainstorm and refine metrics for user adoption, feature usage, performance, and overall user satisfaction. Examples of prompts include, "What are good metrics to track user engagement with the content creation module in an MVP phase?" The AI chat might then suggest options, leading to more specific prompts like: "How can we measure user satisfaction qualitatively?" This stage ensured we had clear criteria for success and a way to evaluate the MVP, developed through an iterative exchange with the AI chat assistant.

* **Outlining UI/UX Guidelines (The "User Experience"):** To ensure a consistent and user-friendly interface, I used prompts, collaborating with my AI chat assistant, to establish core UI/UX principles. We focused on guidelines for clarity, simplicity, feedback, intuitive controls, readability, responsiveness, and accessibility. Prompts included questions like, "What are essential UI/UX guidelines for a web application focused on content creation and consumption?" and the AI chat would contribute, prompting further refinement with: "How can we ensure accessibility is considered even in the MVP phase?" This stage was about defining the user experience vision for the application, co-created with the AI chat assistant.

* **Specifying Non-Functional Requirements & Constraints (The "Quality Attributes"):** I then turned to other critical non-functional requirements, using prompts in dialogue with my AI chat assistant to detail security, privacy, operational, usability, accessibility, maintainability, and code quality considerations. For example, I might ask, "What are the essential security requirements for an MVP handling user data and content?" and the AI chat would provide a starting point, which we then refined with prompts like: "What basic accessibility considerations should be integrated from the start?" This stage ensured we addressed key quality attributes beyond just features through a collaborative prompting process with the AI chat assistant.

* **Structuring Timeline & Deliverables (The "When & What" - Planning):** Finally, I used prompts, working with my AI chat assistant, to outline a phased timeline with specific deliverables for each phase. We broke down the development process into logical phases (setup, backend, frontend, integration, testing, release) and defined concrete deliverables for each. Prompts like, "Break down the MVP development into logical phases." would be followed up with: "What are the essential deliverables for each phase in a typical application development lifecycle?" This stage provided a structured plan for development execution, developed in collaboration with the AI chat assistant.

## III. Key Benefits & Lessons Learned

My experiment demonstrates that iterative prompt engineering with a conversational AI is not just a novel approach, but a genuinely powerful technique for building robust application specifications. Its a process that moves beyond simply seeking code snippets from AI, and instead leverages AI as a collaborative partner in the crucial early stages of software design and planning.

The benefits are clear: enhanced requirement clarity, proactive risk reduction, and the insightful collaboration of an AI thought partner. While practical considerations like managing chat length and platform limitations exist, these are outweighed by the potential gains in efficiency and specification quality. And perhaps most importantly, this process can help solo developers, and potentially larger teams, create a much clearer, more detailed, and more AI-ready blueprint before a single line of code is written.

This led me to the question: Are we witnessing a resurgence of prescriptive software specifications, now amplified and enhanced by the power of AI? As AI development assistants become increasingly sophisticated, could prompt-engineered specifications become a new best practice, especially when aiming to leverage AI in later development phases?
