## HTML first design
"HTML first design" in web design refers to a development approach that prioritizes the creation of the core HTML structure and content of a webpage before focusing on styling (CSS) or interactive functionality (JavaScript).
This approach emphasizes building a solid, semantic HTML foundation first, ensuring the content is well-organized and accessible. The rationale behind this is that HTML provides the fundamental structure and meaning of a webpage, and it's impractical to style or add behavior to something that doesn't yet exist or is poorly structured.

**Key aspects of HTML first design:**
**Foundation and Structure:**
HTML serves as the skeleton of the webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. Building this structure first ensures a logical flow and hierarchy of information.
**Content Focus:**
It encourages focusing on the content itself and its organization, rather than getting sidetracked by visual aesthetics or complex interactions early in the process.
**Accessibility:**
A well-structured HTML document is inherently more accessible, as screen readers and other assistive technologies can better interpret the content.
**Progressive Enhancement:**
This approach aligns with the principle of progressive enhancement, where a basic, functional HTML page is created first, and then layers of CSS and JavaScript are added to enhance the user experience.
**Maintainability:**
Clean and semantic HTML leads to more readable and maintainable code, making it easier to update and debug in the long run.
While CSS and JavaScript are essential for modern web design, starting with HTML ensures a robust and meaningful foundation upon which to build the visual presentation and interactive elements.

## Mobile First
### cite: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/mobile-first.

Mobile first design is an approach that embraces the constraints of smaller screens and focuses on what’s indispensable for users to improve the overall [mobile User Experience](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/mobile-ux-design "What is Mobile User Experience (UX) Design?") (UX).

The mobile first design approach involves starting the product design process by designing for the smallest device first and progressively enhancing the design features for larger layouts—e.g., start designing for mobile and then move on to desktop.

There are other approaches to mobile [UX design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design "What is User Experience (UX) Design?"), like [content-first](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/content-first "What is Content-First?") or [task-oriented design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/task-oriented-design "What is Task-Oriented Design?"). Mobile first was initially proposed in 2009 by Luke Wroblewski, Google's Product Director. In his book _Mobile First_, Wroblewski explains that designing web products, starting with the desktop version, is becoming a backward way of thinking about design. Instead, he suggests adopting the mobile-first approach, which forces the designer to focus and enables [innovation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/innovation "What is Innovation in UX/UI Design?").

## Progressive Enhancement vs. Graceful Degradation

Mobile first supports itself in the concept of [progressive enhancement](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/adaptive-design "What is Adaptive Design?"). This [web design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/web-design "What is Web Design?") strategy emphasizes web content first, providing universal access to essential content and allowing users with additional browser features or faster internet to receive an enhanced version of the same page.

Progressive enhancement shares some commonalities with another well-known web design concept, "graceful degradation." One of them is their goal of making content available for all and how it looks in different browsers. However, the difference is that graceful degradation focuses on designing for the most capable and up-to-date web browsers. At the same time, progressive enhancement is concerned solely with content availability, which is why it is preferred for modern web design.

## Mobile First Approach Core Principles

1. **Keep it simple:** Consider [white space](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/negative-space "What is Negative Space?") as another design element you can use in your favor. White space enables you to maintain a clean, clutter-free layout that is free of distractions. Similarly, ensure your [navigation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/navigation "What is Navigation in UX/UI Design?") contains only the most essential items, as [human memory](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-memory "What is Human Memory?") can only store between 5 and 9 items.

2. **[Visual hierarchy](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy "What is Visual Hierarchy?"):** Mobile first is content-first, so focus on providing a clear and concise experience by prioritizing information. In other words, show your users what content is most important by using headings, paragraphs, captions, and other text styles to get your message across.

3. **Optimize text for visual scanning:** Users do not read; they scan. People will look for patterns systematically to make sense of what is in front of them, such as from left to right or top to bottom. You can take advantage of that quirk and position your most important information following a known pattern. Also, add the most critical bits of information above the fold and use short paragraphs no longer than two or three sentences.

4. **Do not use hover effects** on mobile, as they are impossible to implement. Instead, use touch or slide events. Furthermore, "think app" and utilize the gestures that users already know.

5. **Leave complex graphs and images for the desktop version:** optimize your images so there are no awkward cuts on mobile.

6. **Make your design fat-finger-friendly:** this means designing wide tap targets no smaller than 30px (Apple recommends at least 44px). When you create tap elements that are easy to find and click, you are also building a more [accessible](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/accessibility "What is Accessibility?") web environment.

7. Consider the [context of use](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/contexts-of-use).

A mobile first approach is about keeping the user at the forefront of your design efforts and concentrating on delivering content clearly and concisely. This means the content should load before anything else, so ensure your images have appropriate alt-text descriptions, which also helps your website to improve its [SEO](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/search-engine-optimization "What is Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?") rankings.

[Information architecture](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-architecture "What is Information Architecture (IA)?") becomes critical when using the mobile first approach, as it helps weed out unnecessary details. You can also use a content inventory document to help you organize and visualize the elements you wish to include.


## What are common mistakes in mobile-first design?

Designers often make common mistakes in mobile-first design that hurt usability and performance.

First, **they overload the screen with content.** Mobile-first requires prioritizing essential information and removing clutter. Too much text or too many elements confuse users.

Second, **they use small tap targets.** Buttons and links must be at least 44px wide so users can tap them easily without frustration.

Third, **they ignore performance.** Large images, unoptimized code, and unnecessary animations slow down loading times, which drives users away (and might make the brand behind the design less popular with them).

Fourth, **they forget about accessibility.** Low contrast, tiny fonts, and difficult navigation exclude many users. Designers must ensure clear text, good color contrast, and multiple ways to navigate.

Last, but not least, **they neglect real-world testing.** Simulating mobile screens on a desktop isn’t enough and may be asking for trouble in this sense. Testing on actual devices helps identify usability problems and delivers an authentic mobile experience.
