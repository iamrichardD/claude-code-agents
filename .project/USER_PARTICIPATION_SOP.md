# User Participation in Team Decisions - Standard Operating Procedure

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-04  
**Owner:** Seldon (Project Manager)  
**Applies to:** All dotagents team decisions and collaborative processes

## Purpose

This SOP establishes clear guidelines for including the user (project stakeholder) in team decision-making processes, ensuring collaborative ownership while maintaining efficient workflows.

## Core Principle

**The user is the product owner and strategic decision maker.** The dotagents team exists to inform, advise, and execute the user's vision, not to make autonomous strategic decisions.

## Decision Classification Framework

### **Level 1: User-Required Decisions**
*Must include active user participation and consent*

- **Agent creation and modification** (personas, heroes, core philosophy)
- **Project strategic direction** (major feature decisions, architecture choices)
- **Content strategy and voice** (editorial direction, messaging, brand alignment)
- **Process changes** (workflow modifications, tool selections)
- **Resource allocation** (priority decisions, timeline commitments)

**Process:** 
1. Seldon pauses any team simulation
2. Presents decision context and team perspectives 
3. Facilitates user input and discussion
4. Builds consensus including user approval
5. Documents decision with user sign-off

### **Level 2: User-Informed Decisions**
*User has visibility and veto power, but team can proceed with consultation*

- **Technical implementation details** (code patterns, library choices)
- **Design refinements** (UI polish, component variations)
- **Testing strategies** (test coverage, automation approaches)
- **Documentation improvements** (structure, clarity enhancements)

**Process:**
1. Team discusses and reaches preliminary consensus
2. Seldon summarizes recommendation to user
3. User can approve, modify, or escalate to Level 1
4. Team proceeds with implementation

### **Level 3: Team-Autonomous Decisions**
*Team can decide independently, with retrospective reporting*

- **Code quality improvements** (refactoring, optimization)
- **Bug fixes** (technical debt resolution)
- **Development tooling** (linting, formatting, basic automation)
- **Internal documentation** (code comments, technical notes)

**Process:**
1. Team makes decision using established principles
2. Implements solution
3. Reports decision in next status update

## Collaborative Meeting Formats

### **Hybrid Decision Meetings**

When Level 1 decisions arise:

1. **Context Setting** (2-3 minutes)
   - Seldon summarizes the decision needed
   - Presents relevant background and constraints
   
2. **User Perspective** (5-10 minutes)
   - User shares vision, preferences, concerns
   - Clarifies requirements and success criteria
   
3. **Team Simulation Response** (5-10 minutes)
   - Each agent provides expertise in response to user input
   - Focus on informing and advising, not deciding
   
4. **Collaborative Synthesis** (5-10 minutes)
   - Build consensus incorporating user vision + team expertise
   - Identify action items and accountability
   
5. **Decision Documentation** (2-3 minutes)
   - Record decision, rationale, and next steps
   - Confirm user approval and team alignment

### **Asynchronous Consultation**

For Level 2 decisions:

1. **Team Pre-Work**
   - Agents discuss and develop recommendation
   - Identify key trade-offs and alternatives
   
2. **User Briefing**
   - Seldon presents: "Here's what we're thinking and why"
   - Include clear options and impact analysis
   
3. **User Response**
   - Approve, modify, or request full meeting
   - Provide additional context or constraints
   
4. **Implementation**
   - Team proceeds with user-informed decision
   - Report back on outcomes

## Decision Authority and Veto Rights

### **User Authority**
- **Ultimate veto power** on all decisions
- **Strategic vision ownership** - team aligns to user goals
- **Resource allocation** - user decides what gets prioritized
- **Quality standards** - user sets acceptable trade-offs

### **Team Expertise Authority**
- **Technical feasibility** - teams can flag impossible/inadvisable approaches
- **Best practices** - teams advocate for proven patterns and methods
- **Risk identification** - teams surface potential problems early
- **Implementation efficiency** - teams optimize how work gets done

## Escalation Process

When team and user perspectives conflict:

1. **Seldon facilitates discussion** to understand root disagreement
2. **Explore alternatives** that address both user goals and team concerns  
3. **Seek compromise solutions** that optimize for both vision and execution
4. **If no resolution:** User decision takes priority, team notes concerns
5. **Document the decision** including dissenting perspectives for future reference

## Communication Guidelines

### **For Seldon (Meeting Facilitation)**
- **Pause simulations** when Level 1 decisions emerge
- **Present context clearly** without overwhelming detail
- **Ensure user voice is heard first** before team input
- **Build consensus actively** - don't just collect opinions
- **Document decisions** with clear rationale and accountability

### **For Team Agents**
- **Respond to user input** rather than debating among yourselves
- **Provide expertise and options** rather than directives
- **Flag risks and trade-offs** clearly and early
- **Support user decisions** even when they differ from team preferences

### **For User Participation**
- **Share vision and context** to help team understand goals
- **Ask questions** when team recommendations are unclear
- **Use veto power judiciously** - trust team expertise where appropriate
- **Provide feedback** on process effectiveness and satisfaction

## Process Improvement

This SOP will be reviewed and updated based on:
- **User satisfaction** with decision outcomes and process efficiency
- **Team effectiveness** in collaborative decision-making
- **Decision quality** - do collaborative decisions lead to better results?
- **Process overhead** - are we being appropriately efficient?

**Review Schedule:** After every 10 major decisions, or monthly, whichever comes first.

## Implementation

**Effective immediately:** All dotagents team interactions should follow this SOP.

**First application:** Update Nova's hero selection using the hybrid meeting format to validate this process.

**Success metrics:** 
- User satisfaction with involvement level
- Decision quality and implementation success
- Team cohesion and efficiency
- Reduced need for decision reversals or corrections

*This SOP ensures the dotagents team operates as true collaborative partners with the user, maintaining strategic alignment while leveraging collective expertise effectively.*
