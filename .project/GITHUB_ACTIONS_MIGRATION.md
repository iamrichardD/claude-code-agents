# GitHub Actions Astro Deployment Migration

## Migration Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

The migration from legacy docs/ directory deployment to GitHub Actions has been completed and is ready for implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Created
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose**: Automated Astro build and GitHub Pages deployment
- **Triggers**: Push to main branch, PR to main branch, manual dispatch

### 2. Astro Configuration Updated
- **File**: `.project/src-gh-pages/astro.config.mjs`
- **Change**: Dynamic `outDir` based on NODE_ENV
  - Development: `../../docs` (legacy compatibility)
  - Production: `./dist` (GitHub Actions)

### 3. BASE_URL Navigation Issues Fixed
- Fixed favicon loading with BASE_URL prefix
- Created missing favicon.svg file
- Added proper CTA button styling
- All navigation now correctly uses BASE_URL

### 4. Build Verification
- ✅ Production build completes successfully
- ✅ All 7 pages generate correctly
- ✅ No build errors or warnings

## Required GitHub Repository Configuration

To complete the migration, the following repository settings must be updated:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions for Pages
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** instead of "Deploy from a branch"
3. This allows the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy directly to Pages

### Step 2: Verify Repository Permissions
The workflow requires these permissions (already configured in `deploy.yml`):
- `contents: read` - Read repository contents
- `pages: write` - Write to GitHub Pages
- `id-token: write` - OIDC token for secure deployment

### Step 3: Optional Branch Protection
Consider enabling branch protection for `main`:
1. Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`
2. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
3. Select the "Build Astro Site" check

## Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment
1. Push changes to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys
3. Site updates at https://iamrichardd.github.io/dotagents/

### Manual Deployment
1. Go to Actions tab → "Deploy Astro to GitHub Pages"
2. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

## Testing Checklist

After enabling GitHub Actions deployment:

- [ ] Visit https://iamrichardd.github.io/dotagents/
- [ ] Verify favicon loads correctly
- [ ] Test all navigation links
- [ ] Test CTA button functionality
- [ ] Verify article pages load properly
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, immediately rollback:

1. **Quick Rollback**: Revert Pages source to "Deploy from a branch" → docs/ directory
2. **Full Rollback**: Revert the commit with these changes
3. **Emergency**: Manually copy content from docs/ to gh-pages branch

## Post-Migration Cleanup

After successful deployment:

1. Remove docs/ directory from git tracking:
   ```bash
   git rm -r docs/
   ```

2. Update .gitignore:
   ```bash
   echo "docs/" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. Update development documentation to reflect new process

## Benefits of New Deployment

- **Automated**: No manual build and commit process
- **Consistent**: Same build process for every deployment  
- **Fast**: Deploy in under 5 minutes vs manual process
- **Safe**: Built-in rollback capabilities
- **Tested**: All changes are built and validated before deployment

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs in the "Actions" tab
2. Verify the production build works locally: `NODE_ENV=production npm run build`
3. Review this migration document for configuration steps
