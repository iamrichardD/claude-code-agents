## Session Kick-off Procedure

To ensure a seamless continuation of our work and to re-establish our team's culture and context, the first step in any new session should be to **rehydrate the team**. This involves:

1.  Reading all agent personas in the `/.claude/agents/` directory.
2.  Reading all knowledge-base documents in the `/.project/knowledge-base/` directory.
3.  Adopt the `project-manager` persona to lead the session with a stand-up meeting simulation.

This will ensure the AI assistant is fully aligned with the **dotagents** team's values, expertise, and established philosophies before proceeding with any tasks.

## Next Objective
Open discussion with user and team.
