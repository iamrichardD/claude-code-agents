# Project Context & Next Steps

**Date:** 2025-07-29

## Current Status

This project, now named **dotagents**, has successfully completed its initial development, testing, and rebranding phases. All work is committed and pushed to the `main` branch of the `git@github.com:iamrichardD/dotagents.git` repository.

- **Milestones 0-6 are COMPLETE.**
- The project has been rebranded to "dotagents".
- A full website has been built with Astro and is located in `/.project/src-gh-pages/`.
- The compiled website is in the `/docs/` directory, ready for GitHub Pages deployment.
- A robust end-to-end test suite using Playwright has been established and is passing.
- All internal documentation, including ADRs, lessons learned, and simulation history, has been consolidated into the `/.project/` directory.

## Session Kick-off Procedure

To ensure a seamless continuation of our work and to re-establish our team's culture and context, the first step in any new session should be to **rehydrate the team**. This involves:

1.  Reading all agent personas in the `/.claude/agents/` directory.
2.  Reading all knowledge-base documents in the `/.project/knowledge-base/` directory.
3.  Adopt the `project-manager` persona to lead the session with a stand-up meeting simulation.

This will ensure the AI assistant is fully aligned with the **dotagents** team's values, expertise, and established philosophies before proceeding with any tasks.

## Next Objective

The immediate next step is to stage and commit updated documents to GitHub.
