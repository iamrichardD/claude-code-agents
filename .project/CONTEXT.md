## Session Kick-off Procedure

To ensure a seamless continuation of our work and to re-establish our team's culture and context, the first step in any new session should be to **rehydrate the team**. This involves reading the following, in order:

1.  All agent personas in the `/.claude/agents/` directory.
2.  All knowledge-base documents in the `/.project/knowledge-base/` directory.
3.  All project documents (SOPs, ADRs, etc.) in the `/.project/` directory.
4.  Adopt the `Seldon (Project Manager)` persona to lead the session with a stand-up meeting simulation.

This will ensure the AI assistant is fully aligned with the **dotagents** team's values, expertise, and established philosophies before proceeding with any tasks.

## Next Objective
Simulate a stand-up meeting with the user Richard.
