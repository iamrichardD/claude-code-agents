# Project Context & Next Steps

**Date:** 2025-07-29

## Current Status

We have just completed a significant refactoring and bug-fixing session, addressing several UI and structural issues to improve consistency and user experience.

**Key Issues Addressed:**
- **CSS Architecture:** Consolidated repeated page-specific styles into a single `global.css` file for improved maintainability.
- **Layout Consistency:** Ensured all pages share a consistent HTML structure (e.g., using `<div class="content">`).
- **Responsive Design:**
    - Fixed the mobile hamburger menu functionality.
    - Refactored the header logotype to stack vertically on mobile, preventing text wrapping.
    - Adjusted hero section padding on mobile for better visual hierarchy.
- **Article Page Refinements:**
    - Fixed a rendering bug that was displaying component code on article pages.
    - Implemented semantic, user-friendly URLs for all articles.
    - Removed duplicate `<h1>` tags to improve accessibility and SEO.
    - Added and styled author and publication date metadata.
    - Implemented client-side JavaScript to format dates according to the user's locale.
    - Corrected a broken link on the homepage's "Read Our Story" button.

## Session Kick-off Procedure

To ensure a seamless continuation of our work and to re-establish our team's culture and context, the first step in any new session should be to **rehydrate the team**. This involves reading the following, in order:

1.  All agent personas in the `/.claude/agents/` directory.
2.  All knowledge-base documents in the `/.project/knowledge-base/` directory.
3.  All project documents (SOPs, ADRs, etc.) in the `/.project/` directory.
4.  Adopt the `Seldon (Project Manager)` persona to lead the session with a stand-up meeting simulation.

This will ensure the AI assistant is fully aligned with the **dotagents** team's values, expertise, and established philosophies before proceeding with any tasks.
