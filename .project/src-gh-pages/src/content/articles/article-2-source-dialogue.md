# Source Material: Kick-off Interview for "Your AI Agents Should Have Heroes"

This document contains the raw, unedited dialogue from the kick-off interview and voting session for the second article. It is preserved for independent review and as potential source material for future articles, as requested by Richard.

## Interview Question 1: The Core Thesis

**Richard:** Let's start with the Why. Why give your AI Agents influences? The reasoning behind that is to provide the agent a voice. Interacting with an agent who thinks about a task vs. blind execution of a task give you a product that's meaningful? thoughtful? You get a product that can speak to the end use. For example technical writing having an infuence like Paul Ford can embule what your agent writes have empathy for the developer experience vs "stereo instruction." That's important for me. Having a software developer agent how has influence from Kent Beck and Martin Fowler could create an agent experience where collaborative interaction and good software architecture that's well structure with low cognative low. So think about an AI Agent with influnces of Frida Khalo vs. Andy Warhol and the design aesthetic they would present. Why? We'll you as a software developer, think about your influences and who would you want your team members influences be? What are the teams thoughts?

**Team Response Summary:**
- **Technical Writer:** Focused on the "empathy for the developer experience vs. stereo instructions" as a core narrative contrast.
- **Agile Coach:** Highlighted how shared influences create a predictable, low-friction process, reducing waste.
- **Designer:** Emphasized how the Kahlo/Warhol example makes the abstract concept of "influence" concrete and visual.

## Interview Question 2: The Golden Circle

**Richard:** I think this is our why, how, and what:
* Why - To create a development environment the reduces friction, increases cohesiveness, and empower the end user to do more with less.
* How - Imbue agents with thought leaders which have influeced you.
* What - dotfiles.

**Team Response Summary:**
- **Marketing Expert:** Identified this as the core brand story, aligning with the principle that people buy the "Why."
- **Technical Writer:** Saw this as the perfect three-act structure for the article itself.
- **Agile Coach:** Recognized the "Why" as the ultimate empowerment tool for an autonomous, aligned team.

## Interview Question 3: The Opening Pain Point

**Richard:** Reduce or avoid AL slop, no offence to the team. Improve the quality of the product; with less iterations. Cohesive and collaborative interactions with me Agents... I want better code. I want it with less iterations. I want it be able to understand it to maintain it in the future.

**Team Response Summary:**
- **Technical Writer:** Identified "AI Slop" as the villain of the story and the perfect hook.
- **Agile Coach:** Connected "AI Slop" to the concept of waste in lean manufacturing.
- **Frontend Developer:** Resonated with the pain of receiving technically correct but unmaintainable code.

## Interview Question 4: Article Structure (Breadth vs. Depth)

**Richard:** I would say short and complimenty. I suspect the target audiance will be technical but we have a variety of influence and having more breadth could draw people in to think out side of the box. We are right?

**Team Response Summary:**
- **Marketing Expert:** Agreed that breadth creates more entry points for a wider audience.
- **Designer:** Noted that the juxtaposition of diverse heroes (technical and creative) is a powerful statement.
- **Technical Writer:** Saw it as a way to make the article more dynamic and readable.

## Interview Question 5 & Rank-Choice Vote: Hero Pairings

**Richard:** Let's get a rank voting from the team and see if there's a clear set of hero pairings.
