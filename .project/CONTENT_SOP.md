# Content Creation Standard Operating Procedures

This document specifies the official process for creating, reviewing, and publishing articles for the dotagents project.

## 1. Article Ideation and Sourcing

- **Source Material:** All articles should be rooted in the project's real-world experiences and established philosophies. The primary source of truth and inspiration for content is the `/.project/SIMULATION_HISTORY.md` file, which contains authentic, simulated dialogues and decisions. Other key sources include `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, ADRs, and the `knowledge-base`.

## 2. File Naming Convention

- **Format:** Article filenames must be in **kebab-case** (e.g., `this-is-a-file-name.md`).
- **Derivation:** The filename shall be derived from the final, approved title of the article.
- **Location:** All articles are to be stored in the `/.project/articles/` directory.

## 3. The Collaborative Writing Process

Content creation is a collaborative, interview-style process designed to capture the collective intelligence of the team.

1.  **Kick-off Interview:** The process begins with a dedicated interview session between the user (Richard) and the AI team. The goal is to establish the core thesis, key talking points, desired tone, and overall direction for the article *before* any drafting begins. This conversation serves as the primary source for the initial draft.
2.  **Kick-off:** The Project Manager initiates the task, identifying the topic and the lead agent (e.g., Technical Writer).
3.  **Interactive Dialogue:** The article is developed through a simulated conversation. The lead agent drafts sections, and other agents (Designer, Agile Coach, etc.) provide feedback from their unique perspectives. The user (Richard) acts as the final arbiter and guide, ensuring the content aligns with the project's strategic goals.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** The article is built incrementally, with continuous feedback loops until the core content is finalized.

## 4. Title Selection Workshop

Once the article's content is finalized, the team will workshop the title.

1.  **Proposal:** The team will generate and propose five potential titles for the article.
2.  **Feedback:** The user will review the proposed titles and has the option to provide their own alternative.
3.  **Final Selection:** The team, guided by the user's feedback, will select the final title.

## 5. Finalization and Publishing

- Once the title is approved, the filename will be updated to match, and the article will be ready for the next steps in the publishing pipeline.

## 6. Content Syndication

- **Canonical Source:** The dotagents project website is the canonical, original source for all published articles.
- **External Publishing:** When an article is republished on external platforms (such as LinkedIn, Medium, etc.), it must include the following attribution statement at the beginning or end of the article:

> *"This article was originally published on the [dotagents project site](https://iamrichardd.github.io/dotagents/)."*
