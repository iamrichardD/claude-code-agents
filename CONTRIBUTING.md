## Bug Reports

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs. A well-documented bug report is the first step to fixing it.

**To file a bug report:**

1.  **Search Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please check if the bug has already been reported.
2.  **Use the Bug Report Template:** Click the "New Issue" button on the repository's [Issues page](https://github.com/iamrichardd/dotagents/issues) and select the "Bug Report" template.
3.  **Provide Detailed Information:** Fill out the template with as much detail as possible:
    - A clear, descriptive title.
    - A concise description of the bug.
    - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
    - What you expected to happen.
    - What actually happened.
    - Screenshots, if applicable.
    - Your operating system and relevant software versions.

### Our Bug Tracking Workflow

1.  **Triage:** The `project-manager` will review new bug reports, label them, and ensure all necessary information is present.
2.  **Assignment:** The `project-manager` will assign the issue to the most appropriate team member (or agent persona).
3.  **Resolution:** The assigned team member will work on a fix.
4.  **Closure:** Once the fix is merged, the issue will be closed.
